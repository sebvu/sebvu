### 🍇Hi there, my name is Jester!

I am currently a second year student studying at the University of Houston continuing to build my path of curiosity through a variety of different projects I tackle!
I'm **keen** on a career path of full stack development, and I promise to anyone reading this they'll look back at my old and new repositories and see major growth over the years.

I hope to also delve into open-source contributing as well as linux kernel development, familiarizing myself more with the linux ecosystem then I currently do at the moment.
