`"The only way to do great work is to love what you do. - Steve Jobs"`

Hi there! My name is Jester. I am currently a freshmen at the University of Houston with a strong interest in software engineering!
I am currently in a mission to reach google my sophomore year (hold me STRONGLY on that) and that will require me to greatly hold myself
accountable for all the projects I plan on doing this summer to boost my experience. So, watch me grow my stats. :)

(will finish my readme sometime)
